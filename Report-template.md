# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the {name} protocol was done by pashov, with a focus on the security aspects of the application's implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or if even the review will find any problems with your smart contracts.
