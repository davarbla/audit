# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **Azuro** protocol was done by **davarbla consulting**, with a focus on the security aspects of the application's implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# About **Azuro**

**Copied from the previous security reviews**

Azuro is a decentralized betting protocol. Anyone can launch a frontend service that connects to the smart contracts and to receive an affiliate bonus for each bet made through the given frontend. Different betting events can be hosted, for example a football game. Odds are provided once by a Data Feed provider (Oracle) for initialization and then odds change based on the betting on the platform. A user bet gets automatically converted to an NFT in the user's wallet.

**Continued**

The `SuperExpress` functionality allows for betting for the outcomes of previously fixed 15 events. Bets are accepted until a round starts. A bet maker can choose one of three possible outcomes for each of the 15 events in the round. If at least 9 event outcomes are correctly guessed, then the bet is a winning bet and gets a proportional prize from the prize fund. If at least 14 event outcomes are correctly guessed in a bet then it will also receive a portion of the super prize fund which is in the form of `AZUR` tokens. A round is called a "super round" whenever a part of the super prize fund is paid out. While the prize fund is sourced from the bets in a round, the super prize fund comes from liquidity providers (the logic is `LP` contract).

## Observations

Both the `SuperExpress` and `LP` contracts are upgradeable, which poses a centralization risk to the protocol and its users.
The `SuperExpress` admin can cancel any active round and change winning outcomes, so he has total control over the bets made on the platform. Also each of the LP, front-end or the DAO fee can be set to 100%, or all three can add up to 100%.

# Threat Model

## Privileged Roles & Actors

- LP's SuperExpress - the only account allowed to use any of `LP`'s functionality
- LP admin - can set the `superExpress` account address
- SuperExpress admin - has total control over betting rounds, can add rounds, cancel them, complete them, set the winning outcomes and set the contract's fees & `betNominal`
- Super prize liquidity provider - deposits Azuro tokens in `SuperExpress` for the super prize fund and can claim fees from each bet
- Bettor - can place bets (one or multiple, for himself or for another account)
- Front-end referral - can claim a referral fee from the bets made through it in `SuperExpress`
- DAO - can withdraw the `collectedDaoFee` from the bets in `SuperExpress`

## Security Interview

**Q:** What in the protocol has value in the market?

**A:** The prize & super prize funds have economical value.

**Q:** In what case can the protocol/users lose money?

**A:** Impossibility to withdraw their bet winning payouts or super prize liquidity provided.

**Q:** What are some ways that an attacker achieves his goals?

**A:** Exploit reward payouts, fees or LP payouts calculations.

# Detailed Findings

# [C-01] Front-end owner can steal all bets balance

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as it results in 100% loss for the protocol & its users

**Likelihood:**
High, as any Azuro SuperExpress front-end owner can exploit this

## Description

The Azuro protocol allows any front-end owner to add his address in each bet placed through his UI. In `SuperExpress`, this address will be able to withdraw a fee amount that is taken from each bet, some small percentage. The problem is that the `withdrawFrontFee` method, from where this happens, is flawed - it can be called multiple times in a loop until there is no more bet token balance in the contract.

The flaw is that even though the method does this:

```solidity
round.frontRewarded[msg.sender] = true;
```

which is an attempt at stopping the front-end owner from claiming his rewards again, this is not checked anywhere. The `_viewFrontFee` method should account for already claimed "front" rewards, but it doesn't.

## Recommendations

In `_viewFrontFee` check if `round.frontRewarded[msg.sender] == true` and if it is just return 0.

# [M-01] Sum of fee percentages might not be equal to the admin provided `total` value

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as it will mess the accounting of the contract, resulting in stuck/lost funds

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a mistake or an error on the admin side

## Description

The input validation for the `newFeePercents` in the `_changeFee` method looks like this:

```solidity
       if (
            (newFeePercents.lp + newFeePercents.front + newFeePercents.dao) >
            FixedMath.ONE ||
            newFeePercents.total > FixedMath.ONE
        ) revert IncorrectValue();
```

While both the sum of the fee percentages and the total value are validated that they are not more than 100%, it is possible that the sum of the three different fee percentages is not equal to the `total` value. Now if they actually amount to different values this will mess up the accounting of the contract, as when a user puts a bet then the `fee.total` is removed from his bet amount, but then different values would be sent to the fee recipients. This will result in either stuck funds or direct value loss for the protocol & its users.

## Recommendations

Change the code in the following way:

```diff
       if (
-            (newFeePercents.lp + newFeePercents.front + newFeePercents.dao) >
-            FixedMath.ONE ||
+            (newFeePercents.lp + newFeePercents.front + newFeePercents.dao) != newFeePercents.total ||
            newFeePercents.total > FixedMath.ONE
        ) revert IncorrectValue();
```

# [L-01] Division before multiplication using `FixedMath` library

The `withdrawView` method in `LP` has the following piece of code:

```solidity
amount = shareAmount.mul(
       superRound_.totalPrizeFund.div(superRound_.totalShare)
);
```

The `div` method here is called before the `mul` method, which is division before multiplication. While it is currently not problematic, because of the way those methods work coming from the `FixedMath` library, it is still a convention and a best practice to always multiply before dividing in Solidity. Suggestion is to change code to

```solidity
amount = (shareAmount.mul(superRound_.totalPrizeFund)).div(superRound_.totalShare);
```

# [L-02] Betters might not have time to bet in a round

Currently, the `addRound` method allows setting `block.timestamp` as the `round.start` value. The problem is that in `_putBet` it is checked that if `block.timestamp >= round.start` then the transaction will revert. It is recommended that a minimum value of a period before a round starts is set (for example 1 day) so that users are guaranteed to be allowed to bet.

# [L-03] Re-assignment after setting a value to a local variable

In `SuperExpress::resolveRound` there is this assignment

```solidity
uint256 roundFeeLP = round.feeLP;
```

but a few lines below there is this one

```solidity
roundFeeLP = compoundRoundFee_.mul(feePercents_.lp);
```

which will actually overwrite the first one. This shows potentially other intentions by the developer or is not needed. I suggest just declaring `roundFeeLP` without giving it a value, as this should be the correct implementation.
