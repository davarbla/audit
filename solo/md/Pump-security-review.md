# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **Pump** protocol was done by **davarbla consulting**, with a focus on the security aspects of the application's smart contracts implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# About **Pump**

Pump is an ERC20 token launch platform. Selling and buying tokens can happen through the platform which itself is using an off-chain orderbook and on-chain settlements. Out of a new token's supply 5% go to an admin-controlled address and 95% are vested over a year to the creator.

## Observations

Tokens created in the platform don't need allowance to be transferred out of any wallet if the caller of `transferFrom` is the `PumpV1` contract.

## Privileged Roles & Actors

- Token Factory - can transfer project-launched tokens out of any wallet without allowance, should be held by the `PumpV1` contract
- Pump Owner - receives fees on each order fulfillment, can update the `marketMaker` address, the status of the liveness of the orderbook, change the `feeRate` and the `vestingDuration`
- Market Maker - receives 5% of the supply of each new token created
- Token Creator - gets vested 95% of the supply of the token over time through the `vest` method, also the token name and symbol are based off of his address
- Order maker - signs an `Order` payload, gets tokens transferred out of on order fulfillment, can cancel an order
- Order recipient - receives tokens on order fulfillment
- Order taker - calls `fulfill` to execute a buy/sell order

# Severity classification

| Severity               | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical     | High           | Medium      |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

**Impact** - the technical, economic and reputation damage of a successful attack

**Likelihood** - the chance that a particular vulnerability gets discovered and exploited

**Severity** - the overall criticality of the risk

# Detailed Findings

# [M-01] Protocol will not be compatible with commonly used ERC20 tokens

## Severity

**Impact:**
Medium, as it most probably won't result in value loss but it limits the protocol usability

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as it will not work with some commonly used tokens, but will work with others

## Description

Here is a code snippet from `PumpV1::fulfill`:

```solidity
if (order.isBuy) {
    ERC20(order.baseToken).transferFrom(order.maker, msg.sender, baseTokenAmount - fee);
    ERC20(order.baseToken).transferFrom(order.maker, owner(), fee);
    Token(order.assetToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, order.recipient, amount);
} else {
    ERC20(order.baseToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, order.recipient, baseTokenAmount - fee);
    ERC20(order.baseToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), fee);
    Token(order.assetToken).transferFrom(order.maker, msg.sender, amount);
}
```

The code is calling the `transferFrom` method of the `ERC20` implementation (`ERC20` imported from the `solady` dependency), which expects a `bool` return value. Tokens like `USDT`, `BNB` and others are missing a return value on `transfer` and `transferFrom`, which would break integration with the application. There are also tokens that do not revert on failure in transfer but return a `false` boolean value like `EURS`. You can read more about such tokens [here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20).

Another issue is that the math to compute `baseTokenAmount` and `fee` in the `fulfill` method of `PumpV1` rely on the `baseToken` decimals to be exactly 18, since the code is using wad-based math when calculating `baseTokenAmount` and `fee`. Many commonly used tokens have lower than 18 decimals (`USDC` and `USDT` have 6 decimals) and some tokens have more than 18 decimals (`YAM-V2` has 24 decimals). While lower decimal tokens transactions can at most revert, the high decimal token transactions can possibly lead to more tokens spent from a user than what he intended.

## Recommendations

Use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library and its `safeTransferFrom` method to handle such tokens. Also scale all token amounts to 18 decimals or forbid using non-18 decimals tokens in the application with an explicit check in `fulfill`.

# [M-02] Fee can be set to 100% before order fulfillment

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as it can mean the order recipient will receive nothing in exchange for his tokens

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a malicious or compromised admin

## Description

The `setFeeRate` method in `PumpV1` currently has no input validation on the `_feeRate` parameter. If the value given is `1e18` this would set the fee to 100%. An admin can see a call to `fulfill` by monitoring the blockchain's pending transaction pool and front-run it by setting the fee to 100%, essentially stealing all of the tokens that the order recipient should have gotten.

## Recommendations

Limit the fee rate to have a maximum value, for example 3%.

# [L-01] No input validation on the vesting duration setter

The `setVestingDuration` method in `PumpV1` has no input validation, meaning it allows the protocol owner to set any value as `vestingDuration`. There are two potential problems with this - using the value of 0, which would lead to DoS of the protocol, because division by zero reverts the transaction, and using a too big of a value which would make the vesting rate of a user to be 0. Implement lower and upper bounds for the `vestingDuration` value.

# [L-02] Cancellation can be front-run

The `PumpV1` contract implements a `cancel` method which allows an order maker to cancel his order. The problem is that anyone can see a call to `cancel` and front-run the transaction with a call to `fulfill`, essentially executing the order and not allowing the order maker to cancel it. Consider adding this to your documentation or allowing some other approach for order cancellation.
