# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **Cadmos Finance** protocol was done by Davarbla Consulting, with a focus on the security aspects of the application's implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or if even the review will find any problems with your smart contracts.

# Protocol Overview

The protocol has three main types of actors:

1. Investors - the users of the protocol, they deposit their capital and expect to earn some yield on it
2. Strategists - the actors who manage the Protocol Treasury with the goal of a high yield on the Treasury funds
3. Administrators - they manage Investment Pools, for example by computing the performance of the Strategists and writing it on-chain, acting as an off-chain oracle

A typical usage flow would be the following:

1. Investors deposit capital (for example `DAI` tokens) to a Settlement Pool and receive Settlement Pool Tokens (ERC20) back
2. At some point Administrator triggers a transaction to pull the deposited funds from the Settlement Pool to an Investment Pool
3. Now Administrator moves the deposited funds again, this time from Investment Pool to Treasury
4. A Strategist fine-tunes the investment approach for the deposited funds so that he can increase the Pool Net Asset Value
5. After a while, the Investor can redeem his initial capital plus the yield accrued by burning his Investment Pool Tokens.

**Liquidation state of an Investment Pool**

An Investment Pool's Administrator can place it in a liquidation state at any time. This applies some constraints to the Pool, most important ones are:

1. Deposits are not allowed
2. Transfers to Pool Treasury are not allowed
3. All rewards are set to 0
4. The Pool state can't be changed

When an Investment Pool is in a liquidation state, an Investor can call `InvestmentPoolCore::liquidate` to directly withdraw his deposit.

Both the Strategists and the Administrators should be 100% trusted, since they have great power in the system, mainly for moving user funds.

# Detailed Findings

# [M-01] Hardcoding gas costs should be avoided

## Severity

**Likelihood:**
Medium, because changes to gas costs have happened before, but it is not certain that there will be changes that affect the protocol.

**Impact:**
Low, because even though calculations will be wrong they can still be done off-chain

## Description

The modifier `markCost` in `SimpleAdministrator` has some hard coded gas cost values like for example 21000 (the base cost of an EVM transaction). We have seen previous EVM forks changing the gas cost of some key things, for example the SSTORE opcode. This can happen again and in this case the hardcoded values in `markCost` might not be correct anymore which will lead to wrong accounting for incurred gas costs. Also if the project is deployed on a different EVM-compatible chain, the gas costs there might be different.

## Recommendations

Initialize the expected gas costs in the `initialize` method and add setter functions to be able to update them in case of an EVM fork

# [M-02] `transferERC20ToTreasury` won't work as intended if `assetToken` is a multiple-address token

## Severity

**Likelihood:**
Low, because it requires using a multiple-address token and a malicious/compromised admin

**Impact:**
High, because users can use 100% of their deposits

## Description

Some ERC20 tokens on the blockchain are deployed behind a proxy, so they have at least 2 entry points (the proxy and the implementation) for their functionality. Example is Synthetixâ€™s `ProxyERC20` contract from where you can interact with `sUSD, sBTC etc). If such a token was used as the `assetToken`token in an InvestmentPool, then the admin will be able to rug all depositors with the`transferERC20ToTreasury` method, even though it has the following check

```solidity
require(tokenAddress != _assetTokenAddress, "IP: Asset transfer");
```

Since the tokens have multiple addresses the admin can give another address and pass those checks.

## Recommendations

Instead of checking the address of the transferred token, it is a better approach to check the balance of it before and after the transfer and to verify it is the same.

## Discussion

### CADMOS 

Acknowledged - corrected.

# [M-03] Front-running risk in key admin actions

## Severity

**Likelihood:**
Medium, because it requires the malicious user to have a script that monitors the public mempool

**Impact:**
Medium, because key admin functionality will revert

## Description

The methods `forceTransfer`, `whitelistAccount` and `freezeAccount` from `InvestmentPoolCore` and `Whitelist` can be monitored for transactions and front-ran. Imagine the following scenario:

1. Bob holds some `InvestmentPool` ERC20 tokens
2. For some reason, a holder of the `TOKEN_FREEZE_ROLE` decides Bob is malicious and his balance should be frozen, so he calls `Whitelist::freezeAccount`
3. Bob was expecting that and was already monitoring the mempool, so he front-runs the transaction with a transfer transaction to another address he controls
4. Now his address is frozen, but he can still move/redeem/swap his tokens since the new address is not frozen

The same logic applies for the `whitelistAccount` and `forceTransfer` functionalities.

## Recommendations

Always execute transactions to the mentioned functions through a private mempool or redesign them so they are not front-runnable.

## Discussion

### CADMOS

Acknowledged.

# [M-04] An important flow of admin actions is not enforced, just documented

## Severity

**Likelihood:**
Low, because it requires either a malicious/compromised admin or the admin to forget it has to do the correct flow of operations

**Impact:**
High, because users will lose their funds

## Description

The NatSpec of `InvestmentPoolCore::setInflowOutflowPool` contains the following comment:

```solidity
    /// @notice call batchSettlement(id) beforehand, otherwise it will rug the old pool tokenholders
```

This can easily be forgotten or missed when executing a call to the method. This way of ensuring proper flow of operations is used is error-prone.

## Recommendations

Ensure that `batchSettlement(id)` was called beforehand by using a flag or some storage variable to be certain that users won't be rugged.

## Discussion

### CADMOS 

Acknowledged - corrected.

# [M-05] Single-step ownership transfer can be dangerous

## Severity

**Likelihood:**
Low, because it requires an error on the admin side

**Impact:**
High, because protocol will be bricked

## Description

Single-step ownership transfer means that if a wrong address was passed when transferring ownership or admin rights it can mean that role is lost forever. This can be detrimental in the context of `InvestmentPoolCore`, where if `transferAdminRole` method was called with a wrong `newAdmin` address, then the `InvestmentPoolCore` contract will be bricked, since it relies heavily on admin-only methods.

## Recommendations

It is a best practice to use two-step ownership transfer pattern, meaning ownership transfer gets to a "pending" state and the new owner should claim his new rights, otherwise the old owner still has control of the contract.

## Discussion

### CADMOS 

Acknowledged - corrected: 

- ProtocolRegistry now is Ownable2Step instead of Ownable.
- 2-Step transfer for InvestmentPool Admin. Role change
- 2-Step Admin Right transfer in simpleAdmin.


# [L-01] Contracts are not directly implementing their interface contracts

There are interface contracts in `interfaces/` for all contracts in `contracts/` but they are not used directly. This means some method might actually not be overriden since the code is not making use of compiler checks. Make sure implementation contracts inherit directly from interface contracts.

## Discussion

### CADMOS 

Acknowledged - corrected.

# [L-02] Using OpenZeppelin's `ECDSA` with a vulnerable library version

The codebase uses version `4.4.0` for its OpenZeppelin's dependencies, but this version has a High severity vulnerability related to ECDSA - [Reference](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h)
Even though the code is not exploitable in its current state, it is best to upgrade the OpenZeppelin library dependency to the latest safe version (4.7.3)

## Discussion

### CADMOS 

Acknowledged - bumped to 4.8.0.


# [L-03] Missing input validation in InvestmentPoolCore::setWhitelistOnly

The only correct values of the `flag` argument are either 0, 1 or 2. This should be validated with a `require` statement.

## Discussion

### CADMOS 

Acknowledged - corrected.

# [L-04] Missing event emission

The `_newAdmin` method in `SimpleAdministrator` does not emit an event, but it should, because it is important that admin additions can be tracked easily off-chain. Emit a proper event in `_newAdmin`.
Same thing for the `whitelistOffChain` method in `Whitelist` - it should emit `Whitelisted` event.

## Discussion

### CADMOS 

- \_newAdmin emits `AdminRightsChanged(newAdmin, 0, flag)`.
- Acknowledged for `whitelistOffChain` - corrected.

# [L-05] Flag has too many purposes

The `setTreasury` method in `SimpleAdministrator` asks for the `FLAG_STRAT_CHANGE` flag, but it is better for that action to have its own flag, for example `FLAG_TREASURY_CHANGE`. Add a separate flag for this functionality.

## Discussion

### CADMOS [24/12/2022]

Acknowledged - corrected.

# [L-06] Wrong NatSpec/implementation

The `setNewSoftHurdleRate` method in `SimpleAdministrator` says "activate/deactivate via FLAG_HURDLE_RATE_CHANGE" but it actually uses `FLAG_REWARD_CHANGE`. Update the flag validation or the NatSpec appropriately.

## Discussion

### CADMOS

Acknowledged - corrected.

# [I-01] Protocol is using an older Solidity version

The protocol is using Solidity compiler version 0.8.3, while the latest is 0.8.17 - you can get a lot of features and optimisations, for example Custom Errors by upgrading versions

## Discussion

### CADMOS 

Acknowledged - bumped to 0.8.7

# [I-02] All methods have `nonReentrant` modifier

If a method does not have an external call then it is impossible to reenter, so you can skip this modifier in such methods

## Discussion

### CADMOS

Acknowledged - this must carefully be done as though the function cannot reenter another function it can itself be reentered.

# [I-03] Check for zero balance in `cancelDeposit`

The `cancelDeposit` method in `SettlementPool` is missing a check if the caller has more than zero balance.

## Discussion

### CADMOS 

Acknowledged - corrected.

# [I-04] Not used event can be removed

The `ForcedTransfer` event in `SettlementPool` is not used and can be removed.

## Discussion

### CADMOS

Acknowledged - corrected.

# [I-05] Not used import can be removed

The `ReentrancyGuard` smart contract is imported in `ProtocolRegistry` but is not used and can be removed.

## Discussion

### CADMOS 

Acknowledged - corrected.

# [I-06] Whitelisting modes should be handled by an enum

The `_BLACKLISTMODE`, `_WHITELISTPRIMARY` and `_WHITELISTALL` modes should be turned to a `WhitelistMode` enum .

## Discussion

### CADMOS 

Acknowledged - corrected
