# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **Bear Cave** protocol was done by **davarbla consulting**, with a focus on the security aspects of the application's implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# About **Bear Cave**

Bear Cave is a protocol that can host multiple NFT games on-chain. The protocol has integrated LayerZero technology to make the games cross-chain - while the games' NFTs will be minted on Ethereum mainnet, the actual game will launch on Arbitrum Mainnet. Honey Jar NFTs are minted either by free claim or with either ETH or the payment token (expected to be $OHM). When a given number of Honey Jar NFTs have been minted, a game winner is chosen using Chainlink's VRF technology and he can claim a special ERC721/ERC1155 token as a prize.

Here is how the flow of action works:

1. (Ethereum Mainnet) A game admin calls `addBundle` to configure the winning prize ERC721/ERC1155 tokens for a game
2. (Ethereum Mainnet) A game admin calls `puffPuffPassOut` to actually transfer the tokens into the `HibernationDen` contract and also sends a cross-chain message to Arbitrum Mainnet to start the game there (calling `startGame`)
3. (Arbitrum Mainnet) Now that a game is running, users can mint HoneyJar NFTs via `claim`, `claimAll`, `earlyMekHoneyJarWithERC20`, `earlyMekHoneyJarWithEth`, `mekHoneyJarWithERC20` and `mekHoneyJarWithETH`
4. (Arbitrum Mainnet) On each checkpoint for Honey Jar mints, Chainlink's VRF will be called
5. (Arbitrum Mainnet) VRF randomness gets fulfilled, setting the fermented jars (winning NFTs) on the L2
6. (Arbitrum Mainnet) Anyone can manually call `sendFermentedJars` to send a cross-chain message that will reapply the L2 state related to winning NFTs (fermented jars) to Ethereum Mainnet (calling `setCrossChainFermentedJars`)
7. (Arbitrum Mainnet) Owners of winning HoneyJar NFTs must bridge them to Ethereum mainnet
8. (Ethereum mainnet) Owners of the winning HoneyJar NFTs can call `wakeSleeper` and claim a winning prize ERC721/ERC1155 token

Optional functionality is `HibernationDen::addToParty` which allows for adding more winning prize ERC721/ERC1155 tokens for an already running game

# Detailed Findings

# [C-01] State is not properly updated on L2, leading to stuck prize NFTs

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as winning prize NFTs won't be claimable

**Likelihood:**
High, as functionality is never working correctly

## Description

The `addToParty` method in `HibernationDen` does not send a cross-chain message, even though it pushes sleepers into the `party.sleepoors` array on L1. Since the array won't be updated on L2, now all the calculations and validations that are done based on the `party.sleepoors.length` value will be incorrect. This essentially means that the sleeper NFTs will be stuck as in `wakeSleeper` there is the following check:

```solidity
if (party.numUsed == party.sleepoors.length) revert PartyAlreadyWoke(bundleId_);
```

Which means that even though there are actually let's say 10 sleepers (they were 7, but then 3 were added), when `numUsed` is 7 then no more sleepers would be claimable - the `wakeSleeper` call will revert will `PartyAlreadyWoke`.

## Recommendations

Make sure to send a cross-chain message to add the sleepers to the `party.sleeepoors` array on the L2.

# [C-02] Anyone can burn any NFT in the `HoneyJarPortal`

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, because the NFTs won't be retrievable from the portal anymore

**Likelihood:**
High, because it does not require any preconditions to be exploited

## Description

The `_debitFrom` method in `HoneyJarPortal` allows burning of any `HoneyJar` NFT, given its ID. This method is freely callable through `ONFT721Core`'s `sendFrom` method, which calls `_send` which calls the `_debitFrom` method without an access control check. This results in the ability for anyone to burn any HoneyJar NFT, no matter who holds it. There is the following check in the method:

```solidity
if (_from != _msgSender()) revert OwnerNotCaller();
```

which shows an access control intention, but is actually redundant as the `_from` argument is not used in the burning process.

## Recommendations

The code should check that the caller actually owns the NFT that is about to get burned - the current check does not do this. Update it accordingly.

# [H-01] Accepting input after randomness is requested can be exploited

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as it can result in a griefing attack on an expected game winner

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as it requires minting a new HoneyJar NFT

## Description

The [VRF security considerations docs](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security#dont-accept-bidsbetsinputs-after-you-have-made-a-randomness-request) explicitly mention that if an outcome in the contract depends on user-supplied inputs (in this case minting HoneyJar NFTs) and randomness, then the contract should stop accepting any additional user-supplied inputs after it submits the randomness request. The problem here is that in `fulfillRandomWords` the `_setFermentedJars` method is called where the number of HoneyJar NFTs minted for a bundle is used for the process of choosing the winning NFT - this means that the `fulfillRandomWords` transaction can be front-ran with a HoneyJar NFT mint and the winner will be different. This can result in a griefing attack for an expected winner of a game.

## Recommendations

Decouple the randomness request and the user input from each other. Use only the user input that has been submitted pre-requesting randomness.

# [M-01] The `fulfillRandomWords` method might revert with out of gas error

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as randomness won't be fulfilled

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires misconfiguration of gas

## Description

The `fulfillRandomWords` method in `HibernationDen` calls the internal `_setFermentedJars` method which loops over the `fermentedJars` array and also has an external call. This is a potential problem as this code might require a lot of gas and make the `fulfillRandomWords` method revert which is problematic for a VRF integration (it is listed in the [VRF Security Considerations docs](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security#fulfillrandomwords-must-not-revert)).

Another such issue in the method is this code:

```solidity
if (party.assetChainId != getChainId() && address(honeyJarPortal) != address(0) && address(this).balance != 0) {
    uint256 sendAmount = address(this).balance / party.checkpoints.length;
    honeyJarPortal.sendFermentedJars{value: sendAmount}(
        address(this), party.assetChainId, party.bundleId, fermentedJars
    );
}
```

The problem is that when `party.assetChainId != getChainId() && address(honeyJarPortal) != address(0)` are true, then the only thing left to go into the `if` statement is `address(this).balance != 0` - this is easily exploitable as anyone can send 1 wei of ETH into the contract, which will make the expression evaluate to `true`. This will add additional gas cost overhead as it will execute an external call that has more logic, and also the cross-chain call is almost certainly failing as the `sendAmount` is possible to have rounded down to zero (if `address(this).balance` was 1 but `party.checkpoints.length` was more than 1).

## Recommendations

Consider caching the randomness received and then letting an externally owed account for example to actually make the `_setFermentedJars` call so it can set the correct gas. Also check that the balance is enough to do the `sendFermentedJars` call, not just that the balance is non-zero.

# [M-02] Contract `HibernationDen` can receive ETH but it can't be withdrawn

## Severity

**Impact:**
Medium, as it will result in stuck funds, but they will just have the value of gas refunded

**Likelihood:**
Medium, as it will happen when there is a refund from a cross-chain call

## Description

The `HibernationDen` contract has a `receive` method. This is mostly expected to be used for `LayerZero` refunds as the comment above the method says. The problem is that this gas refunds ETH won't be withdrawable as there is no method for ETH withdraw in the contract. Another issue is that anyone can mistakenly send ETH to `HibernationDen` and it will be stuck there.

## Recommendations

Add a method that can withdraw ETH from the `HibernationDen` contract.

# [M-03] Centralization attack vectors are present in the code

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as some accounts can brick the game

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a malicious or compromised owner/admin account

## Description

There are multiple centralization attack vectors present in the contracts. Examples are:

- `HibernationDen::setVRFConfig` - updating this with arbitrary values can break the game
- `HoneyJarPortal::setHibernationDen` - updating it to a random address will DoS the game
- `HoneyJarPortal::setAdapterParams` - using too low of a `gasLimit` value will result in out of gas reverts

## Recommendations

Make the methods callable only once or add them to the constructors/initializer methods.

# [L-01] Not enforced checkpoints gap size

For the `checkpoints` field in the `SlumberParty` struct we have the following comment:

> /// @dev the gap between checkpoints MUST be big enough so that a user can't mint through multiple checkpoints.

This is just an assumption, as the place where the `checkpoints` value is set (`HibernationDen::addBundle`) does not actually enforce this. This couldn't actually lead to a serious problem but it is best that the comment is removed and actual checks & validations are implemented in the code, so the gap between the set checkpoints can't be too small.
