# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **Museum of Mahomes** protocol was done by **davarbla consulting**, with a focus on the security aspects of the application's smart contracts implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# About **Museum of Mahomes**

The Museum of Mahomes protocol is an NFT collection with a few special features, namely burning a token to redeem the physical copy of the art, as well as an on-chain "reveal" mechanism.

[More docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fymxg-rwKHznj03GaSOcySE5IHkq0eTwXm_ijqysdnE/edit)

## Observations

Max supply of tokens is 3090 instead of the usual 10000. Owner of the contract can update the `price` at any time to any value.

The `DelegationRegistry` is an attack vector as it manages token allowances for revealing and redeeming. It is ouf of scope for this audit.

## Privileged Roles & Actors

- Collection owner - can claim the mint funds as well as transfer ownership, set mint price and set an address to be a `treasury` one
- Collection metadata owner - controls the `revealOpen`, `redeemOpen` and the `baseURI` properties
- Treasury account - can mint NFTs for free
- Delegation Registry - manages token delegations, which are basically allowances for revealing and redeeming (burning) NFTs
- Minter - can pay ETH to mint NFTs

# Severity classification

| Severity               | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical     | High           | Medium      |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

**Impact** - the technical, economic and reputation damage of a successful attack

**Likelihood** - the chance that a particular vulnerability gets discovered and exploited

**Severity** - the overall criticality of the risk

# Detailed Findings

# [H-01] Last NFT from the supply can't be minted

## Severity

**Impact:**
Medium, as only one NFT won't be available for minting, but this is value loss to the protocol

**Likelihood:**
High, as it's impossible to mint the last NFT

## Description

Currently both the `mint` and `mintPhysical` methods have the following check:

```solidity
if (nextId + amount >= MAX_SUPPLY) revert ExceedsMaxSupply();
```

This is incorrect, as even when the `nextId` is `MAX_SUPPLY - 1` then an `amount` of 1 should be allowed but with the current check the code will revert. This is due to the `equal` sign in the check, which shouldn't be there. Here is a Proof of Concept unit test demonstrating the issue (add it to `MuseumOfMahomes.t.sol`):

```solidity
    function testNotAllNFTsCanBeMinted() public {
        museum.setPrice(PRICE);
        uint256 allButOneNFTSupply = 3089;

        // mint all but one from the NFT `MAX_SUPPLY` (3090)
        museum.mint{value: allButOneNFTSupply * PRICE}(address(this), allButOneNFTSupply);
        require(allButOneNFTSupply == museum.balanceOf(address(this)), "Mint did not work");

        // try to mint the last NFT from the supply, but it doesn't work
        vm.expectRevert(MuseumOfMahomes.ExceedsMaxSupply.selector);
        museum.mint{value: PRICE}(address(this), 1);
    }
```

## Recommendations

Do the following change in both `mint` and `mintPhysical`:

```diff
- if (nextId + amount >= MAX_SUPPLY) revert ExceedsMaxSupply();
+ if (nextId + amount > MAX_SUPPLY) revert ExceedsMaxSupply();
```

# [L-01] Reveal and Redeem should only be set to `true`

Currently the `setRevealOpen` and `setRedeemOpen` methods allow setting the values to both `true` and `false` as many times as the `metadataOwner` decides to. This shouldn't be the case, as both should only be available to set to `true` just once, and never to `false` after this. Change the setters to methods that only set the values to `true`, removing the parameters from the methods.

# [L-02] All state-changing methods should emit events

Currently most of the state-changing methods in the `MuseumOfMahomes` contract do not emit an event. An example is the `setPrice` method, which might be important for users or front-end/UI clients that wish to monitor and track the current price of the NFTs. Add proper event emissions in all state-changing methods.

# [L-03] A `treasury` account can mint all NFTs

Currently an account that is in the `treasury` mapping can mint all NFTs for free. While it is desired that such an account does not pay for minting a token, consider adding a `MAX_TREASURY_MINTS` upper bound to limit the count of NFTs minted by `treasury` accounts. You can also make sure that when a `treasury` account is minting, the `msg.value` is 0.

# [L-04] Contract is not working as a state machine

Currently it is possible for the `metadataOwner` to set the `redeemOpen` value to `true` while the `revealOpen` hasn't been set to `true` yet. There should be a sequence/flow of how the contract works - first minting, then revealing, then redeem (or redeem right after reveal). Allow setting `redeemOpen` to `true` only if `revealOpen == true`, and also allow setting `revealOpen` to `true` only when mint is completed (`totalSupply == MAX_SUPPLY`).

# [L-05] Use a two-step access control transfer pattern

The `MuseumOfMahomes` contract uses a single-step access control transfer pattern in `setOwner` and `setMetadataOwner`. This means that if the current `owner` or `metadataOwner` accounts call the methods with an incorrect address, then those roles will be lost forever along with all the functionality that depends on them. Follow the pattern from OpenZeppelin's [Ownable2Step](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) and implement a two-step transfer pattern for the actions.
