# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **Beam** protocol was done by **Davarbla Consulting**, with a focus on the security aspects of the application's smart contracts implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# About **Beam**

Beam is a protocol consisting of an ERC20 token (`BeamToken`), a `TokenBurner` contract, a `Migrator` contract and a `BeamDAO` contract(which is not used and out of scope). The token is a fork of the [MeritToken](https://etherscan.io/address/0x949d48eca67b17269629c7194f4b727d4ef9e5d6#code). The idea is to allow users to migrate `MeritToken` tokens to `BeamToken` tokens where 1 `MeritToken` == 100 `BeamToken`.

## Observations

The protocol token's minting and burning is controlled by an admin controlled role, so centralization is present in the protocol.

## Privileged Roles & Actors

- `BeamToken` admin - can give roles to other addresses in the system
- `BEAM` minter - can call `BeamToken::mint` to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens to an arbitrary address
- `BEAM` burner - can call `BeamToken::burn` to burn an arbitrary amount of tokens from an arbitrary address

# Severity classification

| Severity               | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical     | High           | Medium      |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

**Impact** - the technical, economic and reputation damage of a successful attack

**Likelihood** - the chance that a particular vulnerability gets discovered and exploited

**Severity** - the overall criticality of the risk

| ID     | Title                                             | Severity | Status       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| [M-01] | Minting and burning of `BeamToken` is centralized | Medium   | Acknowledged |
| [L-01] | Using a vulnerable version of an external library | Low      | Fixed        |
| [L-02] | Using an older Solidity compiler version          | Low      | Fixed        |

# Detailed Findings

# [M-01] Minting and burning of `BeamToken` is centralized

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as token supply can be endlessly inflated and user tokens can be burned on demand

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it requires a malicious or compromised admin/minter/burner

## Description

Currently the `mint` and `burn` methods in `BeamToken` are controlled by `MINTER_ROLE` and `BURNER_ROLE` respectively. Those roles are controlled by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` which is given to the `BeamToken` deployer. This means that if the admin or minter or burner account is malicious or compromised it can decide to endlessly inflate the token supply or to burn any user's token balance, which would lead to a loss of funds for users.

## Recommendations

Give those roles only to contracts that have a Timelock mechanism so that users have enough time to exit their `BeamToken` positions if they decide that they don't agree with a transaction of the admin/minter/burner.

# [L-01] Using a vulnerable version of an external library

In `package.json` we can see that the OpenZeppelin library version used is `"@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.3.1"`. According to OpenZeppelin's [Security Advisories](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories) you can see that this version contains multiple High and Moderate severity vulnerabilities. While the code in-scope is not using the vulnerable parts of the library code at the moment, it is highly recommended to update to the latest stable version that has no breaking changes, meaning version 4.9.3.

# [L-02] Using an older Solidity compiler version

Currently the protocol contracts use `pragma solidity 0.8.6;` which is a version that according to the [List of Known Bugs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/bugs.html) in Solidity contains some Low severity issues. It is highly suggested to update the compiler version to a more recent one to make use of bugfixes and optimizations.
