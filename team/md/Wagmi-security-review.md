A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where we try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. We can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **wagmi-leverage** repository was done by **Davarbla Consulting Audit Group**, with a focus on the security aspects of the application's smart contracts implementation.

# About Wagmi

Wagmi Leverage is a leverage product, built on concentrated liquidity without a price-based liquidation or price oracles. This system caters to liquidity providers and traders (borrowers). The trader pays for the time to hold the position as long as interest is paid.

# Risk Classification

| Severity               | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical     | High           | Medium      |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

## Impact

- High - leads to a significant material loss of assets in the protocol or significantly harms a group of users.

- Medium - leads to a moderate material loss of assets in the protocol or moderately harms a group of users.

- Low - leads to a minor material loss of assets in the protocol or harms a small group of users.

## Likelihood

- High - attack path is possible with reasonable assumptions that mimic on-chain conditions, and the cost of the attack is relatively low compared to the amount of funds that can be stolen or lost.

- Medium - only a conditionally incentivized attack vector, but still relatively likely.

- Low - has too many or too unlikely assumptions or requires a significant stake by the attacker with little or no incentive.

## Action required for severity levels

- Critical - Must fix as soon as possible (if already deployed)

- High - Must fix (before deployment if not already deployed)

- Medium - Should fix

- Low - Could fix

# Findings

# [M-01] Protocol charges platform fees twice

## Severity

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** Low

## Description

LP can call the repay on an underwater loan to retrieve their tokens back without their position being restored. If there are no other positions associated with this loan, the caller will receive the collateral minus platform fees and a liquidation bonus. However, there is an issue where platform fees are being charged twice.

```solidity
        if (params.isEmergency) {
            (!underLiquidation).revertError(ErrLib.ErrorCode.FORBIDDEN);
            (
                uint256 removedAmt,
                uint256 feesAmt,
                bool completeRepayment
            ) = _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure(
                    zeroForSaleToken,
                    params.borrowingKey,
                    currentFees,
                    borrowing.borrowedAmount
                );
            (removedAmt == 0).revertError(ErrLib.ErrorCode.LIQUIDITY_IS_ZERO);
            // Subtract the removed amount and fees from borrowedAmount and feesOwed
            borrowing.borrowedAmount -= removedAmt;
            borrowing.dailyRateCollateralBalance -= feesAmt;
>>          feesAmt =
                _pickUpPlatformFees(borrowing.holdToken, feesAmt) /
                Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION;
            // Deduct the removed amount from totalBorrowed
            unchecked {
                holdTokenRateInfo.totalBorrowed -= removedAmt;
            }
            // If loansInfoLength is 0, remove the borrowing key from storage and get the liquidation bonus
            if (completeRepayment) {
                LoanInfo[] memory empty;
                _removeKeysAndClearStorage(borrowing.borrower, params.borrowingKey, empty);
>>              feesAmt =
                  _pickUpPlatformFees(borrowing.holdToken, currentFees) /
                    Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION +
                    liquidationBonus;
            } else {
```

This will break protocol accounting since the recorded sum of tokens will be greater than the actual amount.

Here is the coded POC in `LiquidityBorrowingManager.t.sol`:

```solidity
    function testDoublePlatformFee() public {
        uint128 minLiqAmt = _minimumLiquidityAmt(253_320, 264_600);
        address[] memory tokens = new address[](1);
        tokens[0] = address(WETH);
        address vault = borrowingManager.VAULT_ADDRESS();

        vm.startPrank(bob);
        borrowingManager.borrow(createBorrowParams(tokenId, minLiqAmt), block.timestamp + 1);
        bytes32[] memory key = borrowingManager.getBorrowingKeysForTokenId(tokenId);
        vm.stopPrank();

        ILiquidityBorrowingManager.FlashLoanRoutes memory routes;
        ILiquidityBorrowingManager.SwapParams[] memory swapParams;

        ILiquidityBorrowingManager.RepayParams memory repay = ILiquidityBorrowingManager.RepayParams({
            isEmergency: true,
            routes: routes,
            externalSwap: swapParams,
            borrowingKey: key[0],
            minHoldTokenOut: 0,
            minSaleTokenOut: 0
        });

        // time to repay underwater loan
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 86401);
        vm.prank(alice);
        (uint saleOut, uint holdToken) = borrowingManager.repay(repay, block.timestamp + 1);

        borrowingManager.collectProtocol(address(this), tokens);

        vm.expectRevert(bytes("W-ST"));
        vm.prank(alice);
        borrowingManager.collectLoansFees(tokens);
    }
```

In this scenario LP is unable to collect the rewards after platform fees were collected.

## Recommendations

```diff
            if (completeRepayment) {
                LoanInfo[] memory empty;
                _removeKeysAndClearStorage(borrowing.borrower, params.borrowingKey, empty);
+               feesAmt +=
-                   _pickUpPlatformFees(borrowing.holdToken, currentFees) /
-                   Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION +
                    liquidationBonus;
            } else {
```

# [L-01] Users might overpay while borrowing

The final cost of borrowing is determined by taking a sum of `marginDeposit`, `liquidationBonus`, `dailyRateCollateral` and `holdTokenEntranceFee`.

```solidity
## LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol

uint256 amountToPay;
unchecked {
    // Updating borrowing details
    borrowing.borrowedAmount += cache.borrowedAmount;
    borrowing.liquidationBonus += liquidationBonus;
    // Transfer the required tokens to the VAULT_ADDRESS for collateral and holdTokenBalance
    borrowing.dailyRateCollateralBalance +=
        cache.dailyRateCollateral *
        Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION;
    amountToPay =
        marginDeposit +
        liquidationBonus +
        cache.dailyRateCollateral +
        cache.holdTokenEntranceFee;
}
```

Users can pass on `maxDailyRate` to check if the `dailyRateCollateral` has changed in between them submitting the transaction and the transaction being executed.

There is no option to check if `liquidationBonus` and `entranceFeeBps` have changed. The maximum value for `entranceFee` and `liquidationBonus` is 10%.

Given the unfortunate circumstances of a borrower taking a big loan and governance changing these parameters, the borrower might pay much more than intended.

Consider allowing the caller of the borrow function to revert in case these two parameters surpass a certain value.

# [L-02] Missing check in the `_excuteCallback` function

The `FlashLoanAggregator.flashLoan` function contains the `address(POOL) != address(0)` check. But in case the `flashLoanParams[0].protocol` is not `Protocol.AAVE` the check will be skipped. As a result, the `FlashLoanAggregator._excuteCallback` function can throw an incorrect error. This can cause difficulties with the solving of the error reason.
