# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where we try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. We can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **mass-core-tetris** repository was done by **Davarbla Consulting Audit Group**, with a focus on the security aspects of the application's smart contracts implementation.

# About Mass

Mass Smart Accounts are smart contract wallets created on the account abstraction protocol - Tetris. Account abstraction is achieved in the smart contract layer, through the use of the HyVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hypervisor. This enables the execution of arbitrary EVM bytecode without the need for deployed logic.

# Risk Classification

| Severity               | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical     | High           | Medium      |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

## Impact

- High - leads to a significant material loss of assets in the protocol or significantly harms a group of users.

- Medium - leads to a moderate material loss of assets in the protocol or moderately harms a group of users.

- Low - leads to a minor material loss of assets in the protocol or harms a small group of users.

## Likelihood

- High - attack path is possible with reasonable assumptions that mimic on-chain conditions, and the cost of the attack is relatively low compared to the amount of funds that can be stolen or lost.

- Medium - only a conditionally incentivized attack vector, but still relatively likely.

- Low - has too many or too unlikely assumptions or requires a significant stake by the attacker with little or no incentive.

## Action required for severity levels

- Critical - Must fix as soon as possible (if already deployed)

- High - Must fix (before deployment if not already deployed)

- Medium - Should fix

- Low - Could fix

# Findings

# [L-01] Immutable Aave pool address

According to the Aave docs, the address of the Aave pool should be fetched from the pool address provider contract. The address of the pool address provider is never expected to be changed and is thus immutable. The suggestions can be found [here](https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pooladdressesprovider#pooladdressesprovider) in the docs.

Instead of saving the pool address in an immutable variable in the FlashloanerMSA.sol contract, consider instead saving the pool address provider contract address and calling `getAddress()` function to get the address of the pool

# [L-02] Missing `msg.value` check in some functions

Some functions in the `MassSmartAccount.sol` contract are missing the check that `msg.value == value`. This check is required in functions where users can send eth when calling the function and makes sure that the user doesn't end up sending extra eth than they specified, leading to them leaving that eth in the account.

This issue is present in the functions `executeCall`, `executeHyVMCall` and `performReentrantCall`. The other functions handling eth have this check but not these few. Consider adding this check to those functions.
