A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where we try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. We can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **ethena** repository was done by **davarbla consulting Audit Group**, with a focus on the security aspects of the application's smart contracts implementation.

# About ethena

**Copied from the first security review**

The Ethena protocol is building `USDe` which will be a synthetic dollar with yield bearing properties, deployed on Ethereum. The stablecoin will be 100% collateralized with no collateral within the banking system, using as collateral USDC, stETH and other LSDs. The yield is expected to come from `stETH` and arbitrage. The `USDe` smart contract's minting and redeeming will be handled in a trusted manner by the Ethena team.

**Continued**

The protocol has now added the `ENA` governance token as well as LP staking functionality to incentivize people to provide liquidity into the Ethena pools.

# Risk Classification

| Severity               | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical     | High           | Medium      |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

## Impact

- High - leads to a significant material loss of assets in the protocol or significantly harms a group of users.

- Medium - leads to a moderate material loss of assets in the protocol or moderately harms a group of users.

- Low - leads to a minor material loss of assets in the protocol or harms a small group of users.

## Likelihood

- High - attack path is possible with reasonable assumptions that mimic on-chain conditions, and the cost of the attack is relatively low compared to the amount of funds that can be stolen or lost.

- Medium - only a conditionally incentivized attack vector, but still relatively likely.

- Low - has too many or too unlikely assumptions or requires a significant stake by the attacker with little or no incentive.

## Action required for severity levels

- Critical - Must fix as soon as possible (if already deployed)

- High - Must fix (before deployment if not already deployed)

- Medium - Should fix

- Low - Could fix

# Security Assessment Summary

**_review commit hash_ - [d74901ab42048e142ad53cf4cdfa98a5a82c4ef7](https://github.com/ethena-labs/ethena/tree/d74901ab42048e142ad53cf4cdfa98a5a82c4ef7)**

### Scope

The following smart contracts were in scope of the audit:

- `EthenaLPStaking`
- `ENA`

# Findings

# [L-01] Multiple cooldowns are not managed for the same user

When `unstake()` a given user updates their `cooldownStartTimestamp`.

```solidity
...
StakeData storage stakeData = stakes[msg.sender][token];
...
stakeData.cooldownStartTimestamp = uint104(block.timestamp);
```

It means different unstakes by the user will not go in parallel - only the last unstake will accumulate all previous pending unstakes and can be withdrawn on `last unstake time + stakeParameters.cooldown`.
It is also relevant for those unstakes that waited for enough `cooldown` and are ready to withdraw - such unstakes will wait for a new `cooldown` if some new unstake is called.

If this behavior is not desired, consider managing a separate queue for unstakes and withdrawals, where every unstake has its own storage.
